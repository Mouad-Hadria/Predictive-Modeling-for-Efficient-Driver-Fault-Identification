# About the Project

This project harnesses the power of Artificial Intelligence to improve transportation safety by developing models that accurately identify driver fault in road accidents. Utilizing a dataset that includes information on road accidents, driver behavior, and environmental factors, the AI models show strong performance in fault detection. This project highlights the critical role AI can play in reducing accidents and enhancing road safety measures.

Designed specifically for Maryland State law enforcement agencies, the Python-based intelligent models assist in determining fault in complex scenarios involving multiple vehicles, pedestrians, and varying environmental conditions. By delivering precise and dependable insights, these models streamline accident investigations, contributing to more efficient and effective law enforcement practices.
